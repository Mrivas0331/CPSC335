# This is for the RoboAdd.py file located in this same directory!
Made by Max Rivas, partnered with Marco Macias for our CPSC 335 Project 1
# How to run:
1. It is pretty simple, download the roboadd.py file, and use any instance of a terminal, including VSCode's

2. In the directory with roboadd.py, enter "python3 roboadd.py"

3. The project takes 3 user inputs: 
    - The size of the robot's energy value list
    - All energy values for robot one (# will depend on the size)
    - All energy values for robot two (# will depend on the size)

4. The algorithm will then add the values together given the instructions for the project

5. Lastly, the merged linked list will be displayed on the terminal for you!
