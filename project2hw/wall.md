# This is for the wall.py file located in this same directory!
Made by Max Rivas, partnered with Marco Macias for our CPSC 335 Project 2
# How to Run:
1. It is simple, download the wall.py file, and use any instance of a terminal, including VSCode's

2. In the proper directory of wherever the file is downloaded, enter "python3 wall.py"

3. The project takes an input of a m*n matrix, and displays three kinds of spaces:
    -An "inf" value, where there are citizens fleeing to safe zones
    -A "-1" area, filled with titans that citizens cannot bypass
    -A "0" zone, where citizens can take refuge in
The output matrix will display the same m*n matrix, but the spaces occupied with how many movements it would take for every "inf" to reach a "0"

4. You can modify the test case by doing "code wall.py" and find the test case near the bottom of the page
